                We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules! We got a shot at getting these stones, but I
                gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all
                costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice. Kind of a step down from a from a golden palace for an
                Avenger highness and whatnot. Okay, so the "how" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where.
                Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones. Now, this may
                benefit your reality, but my new one…not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon
                against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So, tell me, Doctor,
                can your science prevent all that? I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire
                new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State. You could not live
                with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life,
                the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that
                remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.
                Remember... You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. Or you're gonna open up a
                bunch of nasty alternative realities.
